# Drag-and-Drop in JavaScript

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to implement a simple **drag-and-drop** functionality using plain JavaScript. It includes the ability to drag elements and reorder them within a container.

## Features
- **Drag Events**: Implements `dragstart` and `dragend` to add and remove drag styles.
- **Reordering**: Allows reordering of elements within a container using `dragover` and `insertBefore`.
- **Dynamic Interaction**: Elements are dynamically moved as the user drags them, providing a smooth and intuitive user experience.
